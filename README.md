# Alex The Analyst Bootcamp

This repository contains the projects completed during the Alex The Analyst Bootcamp. The bootcamp is designed to provide hands-on experience in data analysis and visualization using tools and languages such as SQL, Excel, Tableau, Power BI, and Python.

## SQL
Two projects were completed in related to SQL. The first project focused on `data cleaning`, where I learned SQL queries to clean and standardize data by removing duplicates, checking for spelling errors, handling null and blank fields, and removing unnecessary columns or rows. The second project involved `exploratory data analysis`, where I applied SQL queries to identify general patterns in the data.

## Excel
For my Excel project, I created a dashboard displaying bike sales data, as shown below. The dashboard includes three different charts that dynamically update based on the slicer filters located on the left side.

## Tableau
AirBnB data from Kaggle was used in this project. Three tables from the dataset were joined using an Inner Join, followed by detailed visualizations, and an interactive dashboard was created.
