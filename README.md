# Alex The Analyst Bootcamp

This repository contains the projects completed during the Alex The Analyst Bootcamp. The bootcamp is designed to provide hands-on experience in data analysis and visualization using tools and languages such as SQL, Excel, Tableau, Power BI, and Python.

## SQL
Two projects were completed in related to SQL. The first project focused on `data cleaning`, where I learned SQL queries to clean and standardize data by removing duplicates, checking for spelling errors, handling null and blank fields, and removing unnecessary columns or rows. The second project involved `exploratory data analysis`, where I applied SQL queries to identify general patterns in the data.

## Excel
For my Excel project, I created a dashboard displaying bike sales data, as shown below. The dashboard includes three different charts that dynamically update based on the slicer filters located on the left side.
